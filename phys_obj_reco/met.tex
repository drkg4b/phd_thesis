Due to the conservation of momentum and the fact that the proton bunches are
parallel to the $z$-axis, the sum of the momenta of the collision products in
the transverse plane should sum to zero. Any energy imbalance is known as
\gls{met}, it may indicate weakly interacting stable particles (neutrinos within
the SM, new particles in beyond SM models) or non reconstructed physical objects
that escape the detector acceptance like for example a muon that goes into a
hole of the muon system (e.g.\ supports for ATLAS) cannot be detected and give
rise to fake $\met$.  Physical objects that are fully reconstructed and
calibrated such as electrons, photons, hadronically decaying tau-leptons, jets
or muons are called \emph{hard objects} and are used to compute the missing
transverse momentum in an event~\cite{MET}. The $x$ and $y$ components of the
$\met$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:94}
  E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss} = E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, e} +
  E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, \gamma} + E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\,
    miss,\, \tau} + E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, \text{jets}} +
  E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, \mu} + E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\,
    \text{soft}}
\end{equation}
where the terms for jets, charged leptons and photons are the negative sum of
the momenta of the respective calibrated object while the \emph{soft term} is
reconstructed from the transverse momentum deposited in the detector that is not
already associated to hard objects. It may be reconstructed by means of
calorimeter-based methods, the so called \gls{cst}, or using track-based methods
known as \gls{tst}.

The \gls{cst} is reconstructed using energy deposits in the calorimeters which
are not associated to hard objects, it arise from soft radiation accompanying
the hard scatter event and from underlying event activity. A downside of the
\gls{cst} is its vulnerability to pile up.

The \gls{tst} is built from tracks not associated to any hard object, tracks can
be associated to hard scatter vertices and thus to a particular $pp$ collision,
making this method robust against pile-up. This method is, however, insensitive
to soft terms coming from neutral particles that do not leave a track in the
\gls{id}, thus the \gls{tst} $\met$ is combined with calorimeter-based
measurements for hard objects.

Due to its stability against pile-up, this analysis uses the \gls{tst} $\met$
term. Moreover in the monojet analysis the muons are treated as invisible
particles in the $\met$ reconstruction so that the missing energy is calculated
as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:178}
  E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss} = E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, e} +
  E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, \gamma} + E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\,
    miss,\, \tau} + E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, \text{jets}} +
  E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, \text{soft}}
\end{equation}
where $E_\mathrm{\, x(y)}^\mathrm{\, miss,\, \mu} = 0$ is used in \cref{eq:94}.
