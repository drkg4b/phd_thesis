The quarks and gluons that carry color charge and are created in the scattering
process, hadronize producing collimated bunches of colorless hadrons (jets)
which keep track of the energy and direction of the originating parton. Jets in
ATLAS are reconstructed as massless particles using the \emph{$\antikt$}
algorithm, calibrated and corrected for pile--up contamination. These steps are
briefly outlined in the next sections.
