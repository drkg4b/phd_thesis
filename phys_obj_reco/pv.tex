In $pp$ collisions with high luminosity, multiple interactions occur on a given
bunch crossing, the spatial location of the a $pp$ collision is called \gls{pv},
the one that has the highest $\sum \pt^2$ of constituent tracks is known as
\gls{hs} vertex, the rest are called \emph{pile--up vertices}. The
reconstruction of the PV generally happens in two stages that are often not
distinguishable from each other. The \emph{vertex finding} associates
reconstructed tracks to a particular vertex candidate and the \emph{vertex
  fitting} reconstructs the actual vertex position, refits the tracks and
estimates the quality of the fit~\cite{PV}.

In the current analysis, events are required to have at least one PV with two
associated tracks.
