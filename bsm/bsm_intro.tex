% The Standard Model was introduced in the early 1970s and has so far managed to
% explain the interactions between the elementary particles that constitutes the
% building blocks of matter. Through the years it has been tested in a number of
% experiments and predicted the existence of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, the charm and
% top quark and of the Higgs boson that was recently discovered.
Despite its great success, the Standard Model only explains three of the four
fundamental interactions, failing to incorporate gravity. There are also
questions that are not answered by the theory, two of these are briefly
explained in the sections below, namely: the \emph{hierarchy problem} and
\emph{dark matter}. These questions motivate the introduction of \gls{bsm}
theories.
