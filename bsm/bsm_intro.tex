The Standard Model was introduced in the early 1970s and has so far managed to
explain the interactions between the elementary particles that constitutes the
building blocks of matter. Through the years it has been tested in a number of
experiments and predicted the existence of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, the charm and
top quark and of the Higgs boson that was recently discovered. Despite its great
success, the Standard Model only explains three of the four fundamental
interactions, failing to incorporate gravity. There are also some open questions
that are not answered by the theory as we know it so far, two of these are
briefly outlined in the sections below, namely: the \emph{hierarchy problem} and
\emph{dark matter}. The answer to these questions is the search focus of
\gls{bsm} theories.
