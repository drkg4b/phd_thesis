The sources of background that can mimic the signal are described in
\cref{sec:sources-background}. The estimation of the V + jest and $t \bar{t}$
processes in the signal region is evaluated in a data driven way where
observations in regions of the phase space where an enhancement of these
processes is expected are used to improve the \gls{mc} predictions. In the
search for \gls{susy} with 3.2~$\ifb$ and described in
\cref{cha:monojet-signature} the uncertainty on top processes was one of the
biggest being approximately 30\% in the signal region for the IM1 selection. In
this version of the analysis a dedicated top control region was introduced in
order to improve the background estimation. These control regions are defined in
\cref{sec:muon-cr-bveto,sec:muon-cr-bjet,sec:ele-cr,sec:dimuon-cr}.

The multi-jet and the non-collision backgrounds are estimated with the same
technique as the 2015 data analysis and described in
\cref{sec:multi-jet-background,sec:non-coll-backgr} respectively. The multi-jet
background contribution to the EM1 and IM1 signal regions constitutes about
0.4\% and 0.3\% of the total background respectively and is negligible in the
other signal regions. The \gls{ncb} contribution to the total background is
negligible in all regions.
