The sources of background that can mimic the looked for signal are described in
\cref{sec:sources-background}. The estimation of the V + jest and $t \bar{t}$
processes in the signal region is evaluated in a data driven way based on
\gls{mc} predictions and observations in regions of the phase space where an
enhancement of these processes is expected. These control regions are defined in
\cref{sec:muon-cr-bveto,sec:muon-cr-bjet,sec:ele-cr,sec:dimuon-cr}.

The multi-jet and the non-collision background are estimated as described in
\cref{sec:multi-jet-background,sec:non-coll-backgr} respectively. The multi-jet
background contribution to the EM1 and IM1 signal regions constitutes about the
0.4\% and 0.3\% of the total background respectively and it is negligible in the
other signal regions. The \gls{ncb} contribution to the total background is
negligible in all regions.
