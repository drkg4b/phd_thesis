The search for \glspl{led} in the \gls{add} model is carried out using the $pp$
collision data collected by the \gls{atlas} experiment during 2015 and 2016
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1~$\ifb$. The events in the
signal control regions are preselected using the following criteria:
\begin{enumerate}[A -]
\item The HLT\_xe70 trigger was used for the 2015 data while a combination of
  the HLT\_xe80\_tc\_lcw\_L1XE50, HLT\_xe90\_mht\_L1XE50,
  HLT\_xe100\_mht\_L1XE50, HLT\_xe110\_mht\_L1XE50 was used for the 2016 data.
\item Events are required to have one primary vertex with at least two
  associated tracks with $\pt > 0.4$~GeV to assure that the event originated
  from a $pp$ collision.
\item The leading jet must have $\pt > 250~$GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$ and in
  order to reject beam-induced and cosmic particles background the event is
  rejected if the leading jet fails the tight cleaning criteria.
\item In order not to overlap with other ATLAS SUSY searches, events with more
  than four jets are rejected, see \cref{sec:jet-veto} for more details on this
  selection.
\item The $\met$ trigger can select multi--jet events in case of a
  mis--reconstructed jet. In these cases the missing transverse momentum points
  in the direction of one of the jets, this background can be suppressed by
  imposing a minimum azimuthal angle separation between the missing transverse
  momentum and any jet of $\Delta \phi (\mathrm{jets}, \met) > 0.4$.
\end{enumerate}
The additional cuts used to define the different signal and control regions
defined in the analysis are outlined in the following dedicated sections.
