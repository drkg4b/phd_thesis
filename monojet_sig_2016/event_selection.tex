The search for \glspl{led} in the \gls{add} model is carried out using the $pp$
collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV collected by the \gls{atlas} experiment
during 2015 and 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
36.1~$\ifb$. The events in the signal region are selected as described in
\cref{sec:event-selection} where in addition to cut A a combination of four
different triggers as described in \cref{tab:trigger_periods} is used to select
the 2016 data. Inclusive (IM1-IM10) and exclusive (EM1-EM9) signal regions are
defined in the monojet analysis with increasing $\met$ thresholds from 250~GeV
to 1000~GeV, \cref{tab:sr_2016} shows the exact definition of the signal
regions. These different $\met$ bins are defined in order to address different
BSM signals tested with the monojet signature. For each extra dimension
\gls{add} model there is a specific $\met$ bin that has the most
sensitivity. Since most bins provide some additional sensitivity they are all
combined in the global fit described in \cref{sec:glob-simult-likel}.

% \begin{enumerate}[A -]
% \item The HLT\_xe70 trigger was used for the 2015 data while a combination of
%   the HLT\_xe80\_tc\_lcw\_L1XE50, HLT\_xe90\_mht\_L1XE50,
%   HLT\_xe100\_mht\_L1XE50, HLT\_xe110\_mht\_L1XE50 was used for the 2016 data.
% \item Events are required to have one primary vertex with at least two
%   associated tracks with $\pt > 0.4$~GeV to assure that the event originated
%   from a $pp$ collision.
% \item The leading jet must have $\pt > 250~$GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$ and in
%   order to reject beam-induced and cosmic particles background the event is
%   rejected if the leading jet fails the tight cleaning criteria.
% \item In order not to overlap with other ATLAS SUSY searches, events with more
%   than four jets are rejected, see \cref{sec:jet-veto} for more details on this
%   selection.
% \item The $\met$ trigger can select multi-jet events in case of a
%   mis-reconstructed jet. In these cases the missing transverse momentum points
%   in the direction of one of the jets, this background can be suppressed by
%   imposing a minimum azimuthal angle separation between the missing transverse
%   momentum and any jet of $\Delta \phi (\mathrm{jets}, \met) > 0.4$.
