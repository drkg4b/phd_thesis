Uncertainties due to the parton shower, initial and final state radiation,
factorization and renormalization scales are estimated using dedicated
$t \bar{t}$ \gls{mc} samples. This choice of the Monte Carlo samples is
motivated by the fact that the $t \bar{t}$ process contributes for approximately
80\% of the top background ($t \bar{t}$ and single top) in the signal
region. Variation due to the matrix element generator, parton shower model and
two different models of shower radiation with a different factorization and
renormalization scale are considered. Except for the variation due to the amount of
initial and final state radiation where the semi-difference between the higher and
lower variations is considered, the remaining ones are symmetrized and applied
considering them uncorrelated. Since similar $\met$ shapes are observed and in
order to avoid statistical fluctuations, the final uncertainties are evaluated
in a single region obtained by summing the yields of the signal and control
regions. To estimate the systematic uncertainty associated with each variation a
linear fit is performed. The final systematic uncertainties on the top
background are obtained summing in quadrature each variation. The results are
reported in \cref{tab:top_syst_2016}.
