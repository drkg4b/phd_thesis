The fit strategies described in \cref{sec:fit-strategy} are applied to the
control regions in a background only fit in order to compute the background
yields and the impact of the systematic uncertainties to the background
expectations in the signal region. The results are presented in
\cref{sec:signal-region-yields}. For the interpretation of the \gls{atlas} data
also the signal regions are used in the fit and the results presented in
\cref{sec:model-indep-limits-1,sec:add-model-interpr}.
