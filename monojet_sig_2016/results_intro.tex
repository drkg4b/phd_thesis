The fit strategies described in \cref{sec:fit-strategy} are applied to the
control regions in a background only fit in order to compute the background
yields and the impact of the systematic uncertainties to the background
expectations in the signal region. The results of this fit are presented in
\cref{sec:signal-region-yields}. For the model independent interpretation of the
\gls{atlas} data also the signal regions are used in a background only fit and
the results presented in \cref{sec:model-indep-limits-1}. For the interpretation
of the data in terms of specific models the exclusive signal and control regions
are used in a signal plus background fit and the results of this fit are
presented in \cref{sec:add-model-interpr}.
