Experimental sources of systematic uncertainties derive from our limited
knowledge of the energy and momentum scale of the reconstructed physical
objects, on their reconstruction and identification. Different nuisance
parameters have been used to model the impact of the experimental systematic
uncertainties on the expected signal and background predictions. Correlations of
systematic uncertainties among backgrounds or regions are implemented by using
the same nuisance parameters while independent systematic uncertainties are
implemented by using separate ones. In the following a full list of the nuisance
parameters used in the analysis is given.
