As mentioned in \cref{sec:arkani-hamed-dimop} in the \gls{add} model, the
fundamental scale of the gravitational interaction, $\md$, is brought down to
the electroweak scale ($\md \approx 1~$TeV). At these energies, due to the large
center of mass energy available at \gls{lhc}, the validity of the predictions of
the \gls{eft} become unreliable. For this reason two different sets of limits
have been calculated, one where the full cross section is used and the other
where it is weighted down by a factor $\md^4/\hat{s}^2$ for events where
$\hat{s} > \md^2$, where $\hat{s}$ is the center of mass energy of the
partons~\cite{LEDWeightFactor}.

As an illustration of the problem \cref{fig:shat} shows the $\hat{s}$
distribution in the regions where $250 < \met < 300$~GeV and
$700 < \met < 800$~GeV for the ADD n = 3 and 6 models. The straight line
indicates the excluded $\md$ value before any weighting of the events. This
figure shows that a fraction of the selected events in the signal regions have a
value of $\hat{s}$ that exceeds the limit of validity of the effective field
theory. The general idea of weighting the events is therefore introduced. It
consists in re-evaluating the limit on $\md$ in a conservative way, by
prescribing that all events with $\hat{s}$ exceeding the validity limit should
only weakly contribute to the limit on $\md$.

\cref{fig:vis_sigma_trunc} shows the visible cross section as a function of the
fundamental Planck scale $\md$ in the $250 < \met < 300$~GeV and
$700 < \met < 800$~GeV regions for the ADD n = 3, 6 models. The solid line is
the visible cross section for all the $\hat{s}$, while in the dashed one a
$\md^4/\hat{s}^2$ weighting factor is applied for events where
$\hat{s} > \md^2$, it can be seen that for $\md = 0$ all events get weighted
down since $\hat{s} > \md^2 = 0$. The black square is the nominal $\md$ value of
the generated sample.
