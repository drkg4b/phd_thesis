Different groups provide equally precise parton distribution functions, the V +
jets Monte Carlo samples are generated choosing the \gls{pdf} with the relative
uncertainties (or \emph{intra-\gls{pdf}} uncertainty) provided by one of these
groups. The systematic uncertainty associated with this choice is referred to as
\emph{inter-\gls{pdf}} uncertainty and can be evaluated with a re-weighting of
the \gls{mc} samples (see \cref{sec:pdf-uncertainties} for a more in-depth
explanation on the parton distribution function systematic variations). The V +
jets samples are generated using SHERPA~\cite{SHERPAGenerator}, the
intra-\gls{pdf} uncertainty is computed taking the standard deviation of the 100
\glspl{pdf} provided by the NNPDF~\cite{NNPDF} group. Two alternative sets of
parton distribution functions provided by the CT14~\cite{CT14PDF} and the
MMHT~\cite{MMHT} groups are also considered where the maximal difference between
the central value of the alternative \gls{pdf} set with respect to the NNPDF one
is taken as the inter-\gls{pdf} uncertainty.
\begin{description}[font=\normalfont]
\item[PDFComb:] This parameter accounts for the final parton distribution
  function uncertainty on the V + jets samples evaluated as the quadratic sum of
  the inter and intra-\gls{pdf} uncertainties.
\end{description}
\cref{tab:bkg_pdf_2016} reports the relative systematic uncertainties of the V +
jets backgrounds as a function of the exclusive signal region bins EM1-EM10. The
uncertainties of the various processes are quoted in the region where that
process is dominant. Due to the lack of alternative \glspl{pdf} (see
\cref{sec:part-distr-funct}), the $\zmumuplusjets$ process is estimated from the
$\zeeplusjets$.
