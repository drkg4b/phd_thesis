The generation of Monte Carlo samples is done before or during the data taking
period when the pile-up conditions are not known precisely. For this reason at
the analysis level it is necessary to re-weight the \gls{mc} pile-up conditions
to what is found during the data taking, this procedure is commonly referred to
as \emph{pile-up re-weighting}.
\begin{description}[font=\normalfont]
\item[syst\_PRW\_DATASF:] This parameter represents the uncertainty applied to
  the correction due to the pile-up re-weighting in order to account for
  differences between data and Monte Carlo.
\item[syst\_JvtEfficiency:] This parameter accounts for the uncertainty in the
  \gls{jvt} efficiency relevant for pile-up suppression.
