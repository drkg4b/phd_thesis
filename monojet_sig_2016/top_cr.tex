The Top control region ($\crtop$) is used to estimate the contribution of
$t \bar{t}$ and single top processes in the signal region. It is defined in the
same way as the $\crwmn$ control region defined in \cref{sec:muon-cr-bveto} but
at least one $b$-jet is required instead of the veto. \cref{fig:top_plots}
report the $\met$ and the leading jet $\pt$ distributions after the background
only fit described in \cref{sec:glob-simult-likel,sec:fit-strategy}. It shows,
within uncertainties, a good agreement between data and \gls{mc}.
