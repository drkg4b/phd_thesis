Top pairs and single top production are generated with the
\textsc{PowhegBox}~\cite{POWHEG} generator with CT10 \glspl{pdf} and the parton
shower, fragmentation and underlying event simulated with \textsc{pythia8} with
A14 set of tune parameters. Due to the large Monte Carlo modeling uncertainties
on the top background at high $\met$ observed in the analysis of the 2015 data
(about 40\% for $t \bar{t}$ and single top processes in the signal region for
IM6) this process is estimated with a data-driven method in the combined 2015
and 2016 data. To this end the Top control region ($\crtop$) is introduced to
estimate the contribution of $t \bar{t}$ and single top processes in the signal
region. In addition to cuts from A to H as defined in
\cref{sec:event-selection-1} the $\crtop$ region selects events with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exactly one good muon.
\item No baseline electrons.
\item The transverse mass defined in \eqref{eq:99} of the $\met - \mu$ system
  satisfies $30 < m_\mathrm{\, T} < 100$~GeV compatible with a $W$ boson
  production.
\item At least one of the selected jets in the event is identified as a $b$-jet
  (see \cref{sec:b-jets}).
\end{itemize}
