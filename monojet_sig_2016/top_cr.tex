Due to the large Monte Carlo modeling uncertainties of the top background at
high $\met$ observed in the analysis of the 2015 data (about 40\% in the signal
region for IM6) this process is estimated with a data-driven method in the
combined 2015 and 2016 data. To this end the Top control region ($\crtop$) is
introduced to estimate the contribution of $t \bar{t}$ and single top processes
in the signal region. In addition to cuts from A to H as defined in
\cref{sec:event-selection-1} the $\crtop$ region selects events with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exactly one good muon.
\item No baseline electrons.
\item The transverse mass defined in \eqref{eq:99} of the $\met - \mu$ system
  satisfies $30 < m_\mathrm{\, T} < 100$~GeV compatible with a $W$ boson
  production.
\item At least one of the selected jets in the event is identified as a $b$-jet.
\end{itemize}
\cref{fig:top_plots} report the $\met$ and the leading jet $\pt$ distributions
after the background only fit described in
\cref{sec:glob-simult-likel,sec:fit-strategy}. It shows, within uncertainties, a
good agreement between data and \gls{mc}.
