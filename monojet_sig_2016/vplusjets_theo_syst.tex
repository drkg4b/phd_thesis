In order to account for possible mismodelings associated with the higher order
corrections to the V + jets samples described in \cref{sec:corrections-vjets},
the following nuisance parameters are introduced in the statistical model and
thus constrained by the global fit described in \cref{sec:fit-strategy}:
\begin{description}[font=\normalfont]
\item[$\delta_1 k_\mathrm{NLO}$:] Accounts for uncertainties in the
  normalization of the vector boson $\pt$ distribution due to \gls{qcd} scale
  variations.
\item[$\delta_2 k_\mathrm{NLO}$:] This parameter accounts for shape
  uncertainties of the vector boson $\pt$ distribution due to \gls{qcd} scale
  variations.
\item[$\delta_3 k_\mathrm{NLO}$:] This parameter accounts for the correlation of
  \gls{qcd} uncertainties in the different V + jets processes.
\item[$\delta_1 k_\mathrm{EW}$:] This parameter estimate the uncertainty of
  unkown high $\pt$ \gls{ew} effects beyond \gls{nnlo}.
\item[$\delta_2 k_\mathrm{EW}$:] This parameter accounts for unknown terms in
  the \gls{nlo} approximation at high $\pt$ and for \gls{nnlo} effects that
  might become relevant when hard contributions dominate.
\item[$\delta_3 k_\mathrm{EW}$:] This term accounts for the limitations of the
  Sudakov approximation.
\item[$\delta_3 k_\mathrm{mix}$:] The \gls{qcd} and \gls{ew} are treated as
  separate corrections, this term accounts for unknown interference terms not
  taken into account.
\end{description}
\note{Probably for consistency it is better to switch to the following but need
  to find out what are the extra two NP}
\begin{description}[font=\normalfont]
\item[vjets\_d1K\_NLO:] Accounts for uncertainties in the normalization of the
  vector boson $\pt$ distribution due to \gls{qcd} scale variations.
\item[vjets\_d2K\_NLO:] This parameter accounts for shape uncertainties of the
  vector boson $\pt$ distribution due to \gls{qcd} scale variations.
\item[vjets\_d3K\_NLO:] This parameter accounts for the correlation of \gls{qcd}
  uncertainties in the different V + jets processes.
\item[vjets\_d1kappa\_EW:] This parameter estimate the uncertainty of unkown
  high $\pt$ \gls{ew} effects beyond \gls{nnlo}.
\item[vjets\_d2kappa\_EW\_eej:]
\item[vjets\_d2kappa\_EW\_evj:]
\item[vjets\_d3kappa\_EW\_eej:]
\item[vjets\_d3kappa\_EW\_evj:]
\item[vjets\_dK\_NLO\_mix:] The \gls{qcd} and \gls{ew} are treated as separate
  corrections, this term accounts for unknown interference terms not taken into
  account.
\item[vjets\_QCDSmoothing:] Due to the available \gls{mc} statistics
  fluctuations in the \gls{qcd} correction evaluation are possible. For this
  reason a smoothing to the theory and \gls{mc} prediction ratio is applied for
  the differential cross section of the V + jets processes. The smoothing
  consists of a linear fit of the ratio in the $\pt$ of the vector boson between
  250 and 1000~GeV while a flat function is fitted beyond 1000~GeV. This
  parameter accounts for systematic uncertainties due to the smoothing.
\end{description}
Besides the $\delta_1 k_\mathrm{EW}$ and $\delta_2 k_\mathrm{EW}$ for which the
universality in not demonstrated and are thus treated as independent across the
V + jets samples, the other parameters are treated as correlated between the V +
jets processes and vector boson $\pt$ but independent from one another. The
nuisance parameters are applied by re-weighting each event based on the theory
input of \cref{sec:corrections-vjets}, in particular up and down variation
histograms of the $\pt$ distributions of the vector boson are obtained applying
the event weight and treated in a consistent way to other normalization and
shape uncertainties.
