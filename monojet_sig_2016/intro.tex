The large discrepancy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale is
solved in the \gls{add} scenario for \gls{led} by scaling the Planck mass down
to the electroweak scale and by introducing $n$ extra spatial dimensions of
radius $R$ in order to recover the strength of the gravitational interaction
($1/M_{Pl}$). The search carried out using the dataset collected by the
\gls{atlas} detector in 2015 and 2016 and presented in this chapter focus on
testing the existence of two to six extra spatial dimensions.
