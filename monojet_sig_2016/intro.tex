The large gap between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale is solved in
the \gls{add} scenario for \gls{led} by a lowered Planck mass set to be at the
electroweak scale and by introducing $n$ extra spatial dimensions of radius $R$
in order to recover the strength of the gravitational interaction
($1/M_{Pl}$). The search carried out using the dataset collected by the
\gls{atlas} detector in 2015 and 2016 and presented in this chapter focuses on
testing the existence of two to six extra spatial dimensions.
