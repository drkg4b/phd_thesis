The $\crele$ is introduced in order to evaluate the contribution of the
$\wenuplusjets$ and $\wtaunuplusjets$ processes in the signal region (see
\cref{sec:electr-contr-regi}). Besides cuts from B to H as defined in
\cref{sec:event-selection-1}, this region requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item The online trigger is required to select events with exactly one electron
  in the final state.
\item The muons are vetoed.
\item In order to exclude the crack region (see \cref{sec:atlas-tilecal}),
  exactly one electron with $\pt > 30$~GeV and $|\eta| > 1.52$ or $|\eta| <
  1.37$ is selected.
\item A tight isolation criteria for the selected electrons is required.
\item The transverse mass of the $\met - e$ system is required to be $30 <
  m_\mathrm{\, T} < 100$~GeV, compatible with a $W$ boson production.
\item The events must satisfy:
  $\met/\sqrt{H_\mathrm{\, T}} > 5$~GeV$^{1/2}$ where $\met$
  significance $H_\mathrm{T}$ is the scalar sum of the $\pt$ of the electron and
  the jets in the final state.
\end{itemize}
The single electron trigger, the veto of electrons in the crack region, the
tighter isolation and the $\met$ significance criteria all aim at reducing the
multi-jet contribution in this region. In order to apply the theory corrections
on $V$ + jets outlined in \cref{sec:corrections-vjets} the \glspl{cr} have to be
enriched in $W$ + jets events thus requiring a uniform cut definition between
this control region and the $\crwmn$. For this reason in this version of the
analysis the cut on the transverse mass is
introduced. \cref{fig:ele_cr_plots_2016} shows the $\met$ and leading jet $\pt$
distribution of the $\crele$ control region. There is a good agreement within
uncertainties between data and \gls{mc}.
