The renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties are obtained by
re-generating the signal MC samples varying the two scales by a factor of 2 and
0.5 respectively. The final uncertainty is the average of the up and down
variations. This source of uncertainty mostly affects the cross section and the
results are collected in Table~\ref{tab:add_fact_ren_scale}.

  \caption{Systematic uncertainty in \% on the ADD signal normalization arising from
    the factorization and renormalization scales. The scales are varied up and
    down simultaneously, the final uncertainty is the average of these
    variations.}
