The theoretical uncertainties associated to the \gls{add} signal derive from the
uncertainties on the parton distribution function, the renormalization and
factorization scales, the tuning of the parton shower in
\textsc{pythia}~\cite{PYTHIA8} and the initial and final state radiation
modeling. Since the Monte Carlo samples are generated at the leading order,
there is no parton matching scale uncertainty. The exact definition of these
uncertainties was presented in details in \cref{sec:sign-syst-uncert}. Here the
focus is on the information relevant to the \gls{add} models.
