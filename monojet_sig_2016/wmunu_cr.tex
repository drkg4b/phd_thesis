The $\crwmn$ control region is defined in a similar way as in
\cref{sec:muon-control-region} and designed to estimate the contribution of
$\wmunuplusjets$ and $\znunuplusjets$ processes in the signal region. In
addition to cuts from A to H as defined in \ref{sec:event-selection-1} the
$\crwmn$ region selects events with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events containing an electron are vetoed.
\item Exactly one good muon.
\item The transverse mass defined in \eqref{eq:99} satisfies
  $30 < m_\mathrm{\, T} < 100$~GeV.
\item None of the selected jets in the event is identified as a $b$-jet.
\end{itemize}
The $\met$ and the leading jet $\pt$ distributions after the background only fit
described in \cref{sec:glob-simult-likel,sec:fit-strategy} are shown in
\cref{fig:wmn_plots}. There is a good agreement between data and \gls{mc} within
uncertainties.
