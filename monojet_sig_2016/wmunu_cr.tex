The $\crwmn$ control region is enriched in $\wmunuplusjets$ processes and
contributes to the estimation of the V + jets background in the signal
region. It is defined in the same way as the $\crtop$ control region defined in
\cref{sec:muon-cr-bjet} but $b$-jets, identified according to the criteria
defined in \cref{sec:b-jets}, are vetoed. The $\met$ and the leading jet $\pt$
distributions after the background only fit described in
\cref{sec:glob-simult-likel,sec:fit-strategy} are shown in
\cref{fig:wmn_plots}.

There is a good agreement between data and \gls{mc} within
uncertainties after the background only fit.
