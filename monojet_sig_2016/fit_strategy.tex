The profile likelihood method described in \cref{sec:stat-proc} is used to
combine the background estimated with the different methods outlined in
\cref{sec:backgr-estim} and the relative systematic uncertainties described in
\cref{sec:syst-uncert-1,sec:ther-syst-uncert} in a global fit. The likelihood
function is the product of Poisson probability, one for each bin used in the
analysis defined in \cref{sec:event-selection-1} and Gaussian probabilities that
model the systematic uncertainties. The Poisson probabilities include as free
parameters the normalization factors mentioned in \cref{sec:glob-simult-likel}
used to scale the relative contributions of the signal and background
predictions. The free parameters of the Gaussian distributions are the nuisance
parameters used to model the systematic uncertainties described in
\cref{sec:syst-uncert-1}. The nuisance parameters and the normalization factors
are adjusted to the optimal value by the fit which allows for a reduction of the
otherwise relatively large theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties
(of the order of 20 - 40\%). Two fitting strategies are implemented in the
analysis:
\begin{enumerate}[A -]
\item A binned global likelihood fit simultaneous to all the exclusive $\met$
  region EM1--EM10. A unique normalization factor ($k^\mathrm{V + jets}$) is
  used to constrain all the V + jets samples, this is justified by the use of
  the theoretical framework introduced in
  \cref{sec:corrections-vjets}. Analogously a single normalization factor
  ($k^t$) is used for the $t \bar{t}$ and single top processes. The nuisance
  parameters introduced in \cref{sec:syst-uncert-1} are treated as bin-wise
  correlated systematics and treated accordingly in the fit. This fit takes
  advantage of the shape of the information from the $\met$ distribution in the
  determination of the normalization of the V + jets and top processes.
\item A single bin likelihood fit to the different inclusive $\met$ regions
  IM1--IM10 (a different fit for each inclusive region). The normalization
  factors $k^\mathrm{V + jets}$, $k^t$ and the nuisance parameters in this case
  refer to the specific $\met$ region.
\end{enumerate}
\cref{tab:norm_factors_2016} summarizes the normalization factors and the
control regions used for their estimation. The $k^\mathrm{V + jets}$ and $k^t$
together with the signal strength $\mu$ are the free parameters of the global
fit.

Since sensitivity studies on the \gls{add} models performed in previous versions
of the analysis showed no sensitivity in lower $\met$ regions, the Monte Carlo
samples for \gls{add} are generated with a 150~GeV phase space cut at the truth
level on the transverse momentum of the parton and the graviton
($\pt > 150$~GeV). This cut is fully efficient only for signal regions with
$\met \gtrsim 350$~GeV. For this reason for the model independent interpretation
of the \gls{add} signal, only the $\met > 400$~GeV signal regions are
considered.
