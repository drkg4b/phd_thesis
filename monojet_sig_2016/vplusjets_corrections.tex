The most direct way to estimate the main $\znunuplusjets$ background would be
from $Z (\rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-) +$ jets processes where $\ell = e, \mu$.
However the smaller branching ratio of the $Z$ boson decaying to leptons
compared to the neutrinos makes the $Z (\rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-) +$ jets
statistically limited. For this reason using the decay of the $Z$ boson to
leptons as a proxy to estimate the $\znunuplusjets$ process with a statistical
precision of less than 1\% can be used up to a $\pt$ of the boson of 600~GeV,
beyond this value the $W(\rightarrow \ell \nu) +$ jets processes are
statistically favored and should be used
instead~\cite{VplusJetsCorrections}. The theoretical extrapolation of the
$\znunuplusjets$ background from the $Z (\rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-) +$ jets and
$W(\rightarrow \ell \nu) +$ jets processes at high $\pt$ can be influenced by
several factor including the choice of the parton distribution function and the
renormalization and factorization scales therefore it is important to include in
the calculations higher order correction in \gls{qcd} and \gls{ew}
processes. The V + jets samples used in this analysis are generated at the
\gls{nlo} and \gls{lo} in \gls{qcd} for up to two and four partons respectively,
at the \gls{lo} in \gls{ew} and normalized to an inclusive \gls{nnlo} cross
section. One possible way to include higher order correction to the \gls{mc}
samples relies on the re-weighting of the differential cross section of these
samples to the \gls{nlo} in \gls{qcd} and \gls{nlo} plus \gls{nll} Sudakov
approximation at \gls{nnlo} in \gls{ew}~\cite{VplusJetsCorrections}. At high
energies \gls{ew} corrections are dominated by single and double logarithms of
the scale of the process over the mass of the vector boson ($s/m_\mathrm{V}^2$
where V = $W, Z$) called Sudakov logarithms~\cite{SudakovLogs}. In the limit
when all the kinematic invariants are much larger than the electroweak scale
(the \emph{Sudakov limit}) the \gls{ew} one-loop corrections can be predicted in
a process invariant way~\cite{SudakovApproximation}. This Sudakov approximation
is computationally cheaper than the full \gls{nlo} \gls{ew} correction and since
it includes leading and sub-leading logarithmic terms it is at the \gls{nll}
accuracy level~\cite{SudakovApproximation}. The framework proposed in
Ref.~\cite{VplusJetsCorrections} for applying higher order corrections to the
\gls{mc} samples introduces a single re-weighting factor for all the V + jets
Monte Carlo simulations with a set of relative systematic uncertainties that can
be implemented as nuisance parameters in the profile likelihood method described
in \cref{sec:stat-proc}. It is based on the formula:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:51}
  \frac{\ud}{\ud x} \frac{\ud}{\ud \vec{y}} \sigma^{(V)}
  (\vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{MC}, \vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{TH}) = \frac{\ud}{\ud x}
  \frac{\ud}{\ud \vec{y}} \sigma_\mathrm{MC}^{(V)}(\vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{MC})
  \left[ \frac{\frac{\ud}{\ud x}
      \sigma_\mathrm{TH}^{(V)}(\vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{TH})}{\frac{\ud}{\ud x}
      \sigma_\mathrm{MC}^{(V)}(\vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{MC})} \right]
\end{equation}
where the one dimensional parameter $x$ is understood as the transverse momentum
of the vector boson $x = \pt^{(V)}$, $\vec{y}$ represents other kinematic
variables included in the \gls{mc} simulation, $\vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{MC}$ and
$\vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{TH}$ are the nuisance parameters associated with the
Monte Carlo predictions and the theoretical higher order corrections introduced
with this calculation and finally $\sigma_\mathrm{MC}^{(V)}$ and
$\sigma_\mathrm{TH}^{(V)}$ are the production cross sections for the V + jets
samples computed from \gls{mc} and from theory respectively. The
$\ud \sigma_\mathrm{TH}(\vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{TH})/\ud x$ is first done at the
\gls{lo} and subsequently corrected independently at the \gls{nlo} in \gls{qcd}
and \gls{nlo} plus the Sudakov approximation at \gls{nnlo} in \gls{ew}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:176}
  \frac{\ud}{\ud x} \sigma_\mathrm{TH}(\vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{TH}) =
  k_\mathrm{NLO}(x, \vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{TH}) \cdot \left(1 + k_\mathrm{EW}(x,
    \vec{\epsilon}_\mathrm{TH}) \right) \cdot \frac{\ud}{\ud x} \sigma_\mathrm{LO}
\end{equation}
where $k_\mathrm{LO} = k_\mathrm{NLO}^\mathrm{EW} +
k_\mathrm{NNLO}^\mathrm{Sudakov}$. The systematic uncertainties associated with
this theoretical procedure are described in \cref{sec:v-+-jets}.
