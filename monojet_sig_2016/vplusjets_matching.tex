The presence of large numbers of hard jets in the final state could hide signal
for new physics that involves the decay of heavy colored particles such as
squarks or gluinos. In order to control this kind of events the theory
calculations need to describe in a precise way the matrix element used to
describe the hard process and the subsequent parton shower into jets of hadrons
in the calorimeter. A particular N-jet event can arise from soft-radiation
evolution of a N-parton final state (matrix element jets) or from an
(N-1)-parton configuration where the extra jets appears from from hard emission
during the shower evolution (parton shower jets). A \emph{matching scheme} is
defined on an event-by-event basis in order to decide which process originated
the N-jet event avoiding in this way double counting of
events~\cite{Matching}. Due to the wide range of the energy scales spanned by
the jets transverse momentum there are different scales considered in the
possible overlap between parton shower or matrix element jets. These scales used
in the matching scheme are referred to as \emph{matching scales}. Uncertainties
on the predictions of the V + jets samples due to the choice of the matching
scale for the parton showers to the matrix element matching in
SHERPA~\cite{SHERPAGenerator} are taken into account following the
parameterization in Ref.~\cite{VplusJetsModeling}. This parameterization allows
to obtain up and down variations of the $\met$ distribution using an
event-by-event re-weighting based on the number of jets with $\pt$ > 20~GeV and
$|\eta| < 2.8$ and the $\pt$ of the $Z$ boson. The nominal value of the matching
scale is at 20~GeV, weights for the up and down variations on the $\met$ are
obtained considering values of the matching scale of 15 and to 30~GeV.
