Uncertainties on the predictions of the V + jets samples due to the choice of
the matching scale (see \cref{sec:initial-final-state}) for the parton showers
to the matrix element matching in \textsc{sherpa}~\cite{SHERPAGenerator} are
derived by varying the parton matching scale between 15 and 30~GeV, while 20~GeV
is the default for the V + jets samples. This is practically implemented via
event weights derived specifically for the \gls{atlas} V + jets Monte Carlo
samples. It allows to obtain up and down variations of the $\met$ distribution
using an event-by-event re-weighting based on the number of jets with $\pt$ >
20~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.8$ and the $\pt$ of the $Z$ boson. The nuisance parameter
associated with the matching uncertainty is labeled ``ckkw''.
