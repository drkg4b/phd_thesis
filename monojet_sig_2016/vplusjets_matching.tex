Uncertainties on the predictions of the V + jets samples due to the choice of
the matching scale (see \cref{sec:initial-final-state}) for the parton showers
to the matrix element matching in \textsc{sherpa}~\cite{SHERPAGenerator} are
taken into account following the parameterization in
Ref.~\cite{VplusJetsModeling}. This parameterization allows to obtain up and
down variations of the $\met$ distribution using an event-by-event re-weighting
based on the number of jets with $\pt$ > 20~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.8$ and the $\pt$
of the $Z$ boson. The nominal value of the matching scale is at 20~GeV, weights
for the up and down variations on the $\met$ are obtained considering values of
the matching scale of 15 and to 30~GeV.
