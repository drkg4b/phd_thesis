Systematic uncertainties on the knowledge of the shape and normalization of the
$\met$ can originate from theoretical and experimental sources. The systematic
uncertainties are treated as Gaussian nuisance parameters in the fit procedure
described in \cref{sec:fit-strategy}. A complete list of all the parameters used
to model the systematic uncertainties is given in the following sections.
