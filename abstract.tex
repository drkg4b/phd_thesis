The \gls{lhc} is the most powerful particle accelerator built to date. It is a
proton-proton and heavy ion collider which in 2015 and 2016 operated at an
unprecedented center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV. This thesis presents
the results of the search for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle
physics in a compressed supersymmetric squark-neutralino and large extra
dimension models. The present work uses an experimental signature with a single
high energetic jet and large missing transverse energy later referred to as
\emph{monojet} signature. The search for supersymmetry is carried out using an
integrated luminosity of 3.2~$\ifb$ recorded by the ATLAS experiment in 2015
while the full 2015 + 2016 dataset of 36.1~$\ifb$ is used in the search for
large extra dimensions. No significant excess compared to the Standard Model
prediction has been observed on the production of squark pairs with the
subsequent decay $\squarkprod$ and for the presence of large extra spatial
dimensions in the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali model scenario thus 95\% CL
limits have been set. Squark masses up to 608~GeV are excluded for
$\msquark - \mneutralino = 5$~GeV and values of the effective Planck scale $\md$
of 7.7 and 4.8~TeV for two and six hypothesized large extra dimensions
respectively are also excluded significantly improving earlier results.

The Tile Calorimeter is the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter covering the central
region of the detector. It is designed to measure hadrons, jets, tau particles
and missing energy. In order to accurately be able to properly reconstruct these
physical objects a careful description of the electronic noise is required. This
thesis presents the work done in updating, monitoring and studying the noise
calibration constants used in the processing of data and the identification of
hadronic jets. These studies showed an unexpected variation over time of the
cell noise and further investigation led to discover that the tile noise filter
was not behaving as expected in some situations in approximately 5\% of the
detector cells.
