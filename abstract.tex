The \gls{lhc} is the most powerful particle accelerator built to date. It is a
proton-proton and heavy ion collider which in 2015 and 2016 operated at an
unprecedented center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV. The Tile Calorimeter
is the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter covering the central region of the
detector. It is designed to measure hadrons, jets, tau particles and missing
energy. In order to accurately be able to properly reconstruct these physical
objects a careful description of the electronic noise is required. This thesis
presents the work done in updating, monitoring and studying the noise
calibration constants used in the processing and identification of hadronic jet
in the 2011 data.

This thesis presents the results of two searches for physics beyond the Standard
Model of particle physics. The models that are probed in this work are:
compressed supersymmetric squark-neutralino and large extra dimension
models. The present work uses an experimental signature with a high energy
hadronic jets and large missing transverse energy later often referred to as
\emph{monojet} signature. The search for supersymmetry is carried out using an
integrated luminosity of 3.2~$\ifb$ recorded by the ATLAS experiment in 2015.


The second search presented in this work uses the full 2015 + 2016 dataset of
36.1~$\ifb$ to search for large extra dimensions. No significant excess compared
to the Standard Model prediction has been observed on the production of squark
pairs with the subsequent decay $\squarkprod$ and exclusion limits are set on
squark production as a function of the neutralino mass, squark masses up to
608~GeV are excluded for $\msquark - \mneutralino = 5$~GeV. In the second search
for the presence of large extra spatial dimensions in the Arkani-Hamed,
Dimopoulos and Dvali model scenario a good agreement between data and Standard
Model prediction is observed and exclusion limits are set on the effective
Planck scale $\md$ of 7.7 and 4.8~TeV for two and six hypothesized large extra
dimensions respectively significantly improving earlier results.
