                  detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
                  CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead)
                  collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV
                  nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 10 34 cm −2 s −1
                  (10 27 cm −2 s −1 ). At the core of the CMS detector sits a
                  high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid
                  surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a
                  lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic
                  calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron
                  calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented
                  with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π
                  solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the
                  pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ≤ 5) assuring very
                  good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector
                  are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total
                  weight of 12500 t.}

  abstract={This paper presents a summary of beam-induced backgrounds observed
                  in the ATLAS detector and discusses methods to tag and remove
                  background contaminated events in data. Trigger-rate based
                  monitoring of beam-related backgrounds is presented. The
                  correlations of backgrounds with machine conditions, such as
                  residual pressure in the beam-pipe, are discussed. Results
                  from dedicated beam-background simulations are shown, and
                  their qualitative agreement with data is evaluated. Data taken
                  during the passage of unpaired, i.e. non-colliding, proton
                  bunches is used to obtain background-enriched data
                  samples. These are used to identify characteristic features of
                  beam-induced backgrounds, which then are exploited to develop
                  dedicated background tagging tools. These tools, based on
                  observables in the Pixel detector, the muon spectrometer and
                  the calorimeters, are described in detail and their
                  efficiencies are evaluated. Finally an example of an
                  application of these techniques to a monojet analysis is
                  given, which demonstrates the importance of such event
                  cleaning techniques for some new physics searches.}

                  the conditions in the Big Bang when the age of the Universe
                  was a fraction of a second. It is thought that matter was
                  generated, the structures in the Universe were formed and cold
                  dark matter froze out during this very early epoch when the
                  equation of state of the Universe was dominated by the
                  quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Future Little Bangs may reveal the
                  mechanism of matter generation and the nature of cold dark
                  matter. Knowledge of the QGP will be an essential ingredient
                  in quantitative understanding of the very early Universe.}

  abstract={ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose,
                  heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the
                  strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is
                  designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter
                  and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density
                  and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running
                  with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with
                  lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated
                  proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton
                  beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the
                  heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for
                  which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The
                  ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including
                  currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105
                  Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are
                  16 × 16 × 26 m 3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000
                  t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems
                  each with its own specific technology choice and design
                  constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the
                  experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent
                  design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle
                  multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The
                  different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum
                  resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID)
                  over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest
                  multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for
                  comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and
                  photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most
                  detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for
                  data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start
                  operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon
                  Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and
                  Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be
                  completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in
                  2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components
                  as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.}
