Up to now, we have massless gauge vector bosons, in fact no term such as
$M^{2} B_{\mu}B^{\mu} / 2$ appear in the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:13}, but this kind
of terms are not gauge invariant and thus we can not just add them or we will
end up with troubles later when trying to renormalize the theory.

A gauge invariant way to recover the fermions and bosons masses, is to
spontaneously brake the local $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)_{Y}$ electroweak symmetry.
