As mentioned in \cref{sec:standard-model} the symmetry group of the strong
interaction is $\suthreec$ where the subscript ``C`` stands for the \emph{color}
charge which is a quantum number acquired by \emph{quarks}. Three R, G, B (red,
green and blue) colors are introduced. The symmetry generated for rotations in
the color space (R $\leftrightarrow$ G, G $\leftrightarrow$ B, B
$\leftrightarrow$ R) is a $suthreec$ \emph{exact} symmetry, meaning that it is
conserved by all interactions
