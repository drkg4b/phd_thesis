As new information about the detector becomes available, an update of the
calibration constants and thus of the reconstructed energy must be performed;
this procedure is called \emph{reprocessing}. In 2011 an update of the laser and
cesium calibration analysis procedure were performed together with an update of
which cells were considered good or bad. These updates required a recalculation
of the cell noise.
