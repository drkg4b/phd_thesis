The TileCal cells are read out by two PMTs with the exception of the E layer
cells that are connected to only one photomultiplier tube using \gls{wsf}. Each
PMT is associated to an electronic read--out channel with its own shaper,
preamplifier and \gls{adc}. The current pulse from the PMTs is shaped and
amplified by the 3--in--1 card. There are two possible gains: \gls{hg} and
\gls{lg}, with an amplification ratio of 64. The 3-in-1 card forms the front-end
electronics of the read-out chain and provides three basic functions: shaping of
the pulse, charge injection calibration and slow integration of the PMT signals
for monitoring and calibration~\cite{TileCal}. Up to twelve 3--in--1 cards are
serviced by a motherboard that provides power and individual control signals.
The amplified signal is sent to two \glspl{adc} synchronous with the 40~MHz LHC
clock thus sampling the signal every 25~ns. For optimization and efficiency
reasons, 7 samples for each pulse are taken and sent to the \glspl{rod} if an L1
trigger accept is received.
