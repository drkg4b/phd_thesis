The \gls{sm} of particle physics is the theory used to describe the elementary
constituents of matter and their interactions and through the years it has been
tested by many experiments~\cite{SMTests}. Despite its success it cannot explain
for instance the so called hierarchy and dark matter problems (see
\cref{cha:beyond-stand-model} for more details).

Supersymmetry~\cite{SUSYIntro} is an extension of the Standard Model that solves
the hierarchy problem introducing a supersymmetric partner to each \gls{sm}
particle canceling in this way the contribution to the quantum correction to the
Higgs mass of the Standard Model particles that push it to the Planck
scale. When the lightest \emph{neutralino} (denoted
$\widetilde{\chi}_{\, 1}^{\, 0}$) is also the lightest \gls{susy} particle and
is stable, then it is a good candidate for Dark Matter.

\gls{led} in the \gls{add} model scenario~\cite{ADDPaper} sets the Planck scale
at the order of the weak scale formally eliminating the distinction between the
two energy scales and introduces large extra spatial dimensions in which only
the \emph{graviton} (the hypothesized particle that mediates the gravitational
interaction) is allowed to propagate in order to recover the strength of the
gravitational interaction.

The \gls{lhc} is a proton-proton and heavy ion collider designed to operate at a
center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV located at \gls{cern}. In the
context of a minimal supersymmetric model the neutralino could be produced in
squark ($\tilde{q}$) pair production in proton-proton collisions with
$\squarkprod$. Similarly gravitons could be produced in association with jets.
If the \gls{lhc} produces such kind of particles in proton-proton collisions,
the two main general purpose detectors \gls{atlas} and \gls{cms} should be able
to infer their presence. This thesis presents two searches: the search for
compressed supersymmetric squark-neutralino signal with the \gls{atlas} detector
in the 3.2~$\ifb$ delivered in 2015 and for large extra dimensions in the
\gls{add} model scenario using 36.1~$\ifb$ collected by \gls{atlas} in 2015 and
2016 in an experimental signature with jets and large missing transverse
momentum in the final state.
