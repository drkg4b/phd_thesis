The ATLAS forward region is covered by three smaller detectors: the \gls{lucid},
the \gls{alfa} and the \gls{zdc}. LUCID~\cite{ForwardDetectors} is located at
$\pm 17$~m from the IP, it is designed to monitor the relative luminosity by
detecting the inelastic $pp$ scattering. The ZDC~\cite{ForwardDetectors} is
located at $\pm 140$~m from the IP, it consists of alternating layers of quartz
rods and tungsten plates designed to measure neutron at $|\eta| < 8.2$, its
purpose is to measure the centrality in heavy-ion
collisions. ALFA~\cite{ForwardDetectors} is located at $\pm 240$~m from the IP
and is designed to measure the absolute luminosity via elastic scattering at
small angles.
