A right handed coordinate system is defined for the ATLAS detector, the origin
is at the geometric center of ATLAS with the $z$--axis oriented along the beam
direction and the $xy$ plane orthogonal to it. The positive $x$-axis points to
the center of the LHC ring while the positive $y$-axis is pointing upwards. The
A-side of the detector is defined as that with a positive $z$-axis while the
C-side has the negative $z$-axis.

The LHC beama are unpolarized and thus invariant under rotations around the beam
line axis, a cylindrical coordinate system is particularly convenient to
describe the detector geometry where:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:57}
  r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \phi = \arctan \frac{y}{x}.
\end{equation}
A momentum dependent coordinate, the \emph{rapidity}, is commonly used in
particle physics for its invariance under Lorentz transformations along the
$z$--axis. The rapidity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:58}
  y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{E + p_z}{E - p_z}
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the energy of the particle and $p_z$ its momentum along the
$z$-axis. Rapidity intervals are Lorentz invariant under boost along the
$z$--axis. In the relativistic limit or when the mass of the particle is
negligible, the rapidity only depends on the production angle of the particle
with respect to the beam axis,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:59}
  \theta = \arctan \frac{\sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2}}{p_z}.
\end{equation}
This approximation is called \gls{eta} and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:60}
  y \xrightarrow{p \gg m} \eta = - \ln \left( \tan \frac{\theta}{2} \right).
\end{equation}
A value of $\theta = 90^{\circ}$, perpendicular to the beam axis, corresponds to
$\eta = 0$. The spatial separation between particles in the detector is commonly
given in terms of a Lorentz invariant variable defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:61}
  \Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta \phi^2 + \Delta \eta^2}.
\end{equation}

Other quantities used to describe the kinematics of the $pp$ interaction are the
\gls{pt} and the \gls{et} defined as $\pt = p \sin \theta$ and
$\et = E \sin \theta$ respectively.
