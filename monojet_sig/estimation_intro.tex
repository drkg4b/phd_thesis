A \gls{cr} is a region of the phase space where the looked for signal
contribution is negligible but the event selection is similar to the signal
region where an enhancement of the signal is expected. The main reason to define
such a region is to check the agreement in shape and normalization between MC
and data samples of kinematic and reconstruction quantities. In the monojet
analysis \textbf{number of} control region are defined \dots
