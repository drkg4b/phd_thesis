The results of model independent limits are interpreted in terms of limits
computed for squark pair production with $\squarkprod$ in a \gls{susy}
compressed scenario. The sensitivity to these models is estimated by performing
a global signal plus background fit that includes the $\crele$, $\crwmn$,
$\crzmm$ control regions, the signal regions and all the systematic
uncertainties. The expected limits are derived with the same procedure but by
replacing the data with the background prediction.

Figure~\ref{fig:expected_observed} shows the result limits on the \gls{susy}
compressed squark-neutralino model for the run~2 2015 data. This is the result
of the shape fit with a luminosity of $3.2~\ifb$ with all theoretical signal
systematic uncertainties included in the observed and expected exclusion contour
and using the $\crele$, $\crwmn$, $\crzmm$ control regions. The theoretical
uncertainty on the signal cross section is used to derive the uncertainty on the
observed limit.

Models with a mass gap between the squark and the neutralino of
$\Delta m = 5$~GeV are excluded up to squark masses of 608~GeV. For the larger
mass gap of $\Delta m = 25$~GeV, squark masses up to 532~GeV are also
excluded. The results of this study are combined with the more general
\gls{susy} searches adding sensitivity to the region close to the diagonal
(dashed line) in \cref{fig:susy_exclusion}.
