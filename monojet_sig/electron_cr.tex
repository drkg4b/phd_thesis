The $\wenuplusjets$ process enters the signal region, thus contributing to the
background, in case the electron is not identified in the detector. In the
$\wtaunuplusjets$ process the $\tau$ particle can decay hadronically in 65\% of
the cases resulting in additional jets that can help this background mimic the
signal. To address these backgrounds an electron control region
(CR$_\mathrm{\, ele}$) is built. It is designed to constrain both
$\wenuplusjets$ and $\wtaunuplusjets$ processes thanks to the decays of $\tau$
leptons into electrons. In order to efficiently reject multi--jet background,
the electron is retained in the $\met$ calculation, the missing transverse
momentum in this case measures the momentum of the escaping neutrino. The
CR$_\mathrm{\, ele}$ region selects events with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exactly one good electron,
\item Reject any other good electron.
\end{itemize}
In order to enhance the $\wtaunuplusjets$ contribution in this region, no
$m_\mathrm{\, T}$ cut is applied. \cref{fig:ele_cr_plots} shows the observed and
predicted $\met$ and the leading jet $\pt$ distribution in this control region. The
overall agreement between data and MC is good and improved after the global
likelihood fit procedure described in \cref{sec:glob-simult-likel}.
