For precision measurement of the physics processes at the LHC, an accurate
description of the \gls{pdf} is important. The parton distribution functions are
non-perturbative and extracted from global fits to hard-scatter data. Two kind
of \glspl{pdf} uncertainties are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intra-\gls{pdf} uncertainty: This is the uncertainty within a given
  specific \gls{pdf} set.
\item Inter-\gls{pdf} uncertainty: This is the uncertainty when a certain
  \gls{pdf} is replaced with another.
\end{itemize}
Three different collaborations provide equally precise parton distribution
functions making it arbitrary to use one over the others to generate the signal
MC samples. For this reason the recommendation of the PDF4LHC~\cite{PDF4LHC}
working group for a correct estimation of the \gls{pdf} uncertainty is to
combine the uncertainties from all three groups and thus the CT10~\cite{CT10},
the NNPDF~\cite{NNPDF} and the MMHT~\cite{MMHT} \gls{pdf} sets are used.

The \gls{mc} signal samples for the \gls{susy} compressed models are generated
using the NNPDF2.3 set. In principle in order to evaluate the \gls{pdf}
uncertainties for CT10 and MMHT it would be necessary to re-generate the signal
samples using these \gls{pdf} sets. It is common practice to instead re-weight
each event in the original sample to the distributions of the incoming parton
momenta $x_1$, $x_2$ it would have had if generated with an alternative
\gls{pdf}. This is done using the LHAPDF~\cite{LHAPDF} tool.
% The weight is given by:
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:118}
%   w = \frac{\mathrm{PDF}(x_1, f_1, Q) \cdot \mathrm{PDF}(x_2, f_2, Q)}
%   {\mathrm{PDF}_0(x_1, f_1, Q) \cdot \mathrm{PDF}_0(x_2, f_2, Q)}
% \end{equation}
% where $\mathrm{PDF}$ is the alternate \gls{pdf} and $\mathrm{PDF}_0$ is the
% \gls{pdf} used to generate the samples.

The CT10 and the MMHT sets provide error sets to estimate the intra-\gls{pdf}
uncertainty. The idea is that each \gls{pdf} has a number of uncorrelated error
parameters that can be varied independently by $\pm 1\sigma$ and a new, varied,
\gls{pdf} can be calculated. This procedure is then repeated for each error
parameter in the \gls{pdf} set resulting in a set of \glspl{pdf}. This procedure
is also done using the LHAPDF tool. The Hessian~\cite{Hessian} method is then
used to estimate the intra-\gls{pdf} uncertainty on the sets of \glspl{pdf}.

For CT10 the symmetric Hessian method with 52 error sets is used and the
uncertainty is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:119}
  \delta X = \sqrt{\sum_{k = 1}^{n_\mathrm{err}} \left(X^{(k)} -
      X^{(0)} \right)^2}
\end{equation}
where $X^{(0)}$ is the number of events using the best \gls{pdf} fit, $X^{(k)}$
is the number of events using the \gls{pdf} calculated varying the $k$-th error
parameter and $n_\mathrm{err}$ is the provided number of error sets.

For MMHT the asymmetric Hessian method with 50 error sets is used and the
uncertainty is given by:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:120}
  \delta x^{\mathrm{up}} & = \sqrt{\sum_{k = 1}^{n_\mathrm{err}}
                           \mathrm{max}(0, X_{2k} - X_0, X_{2k - 1} - X_0)^2} \\
  \delta x^{\mathrm{dw}} & = \sqrt{\sum_{k = 1}^{n_\mathrm{err}}
                           \mathrm{max}(0, X_0 - X_{2k}, X_0 - X_{2k - 1})^2}
\end{align}
where $X_0$ is the number of events obtained with the best \gls{pdf} fit,
$X_{2k} (X_{2k -1})$ is the number of events calculated with the $2k$-th
($2k -1$-th) parameter variation and $n_\mathrm{err}$ is the number of error
sets.

The NNPDF group provides an ensemble of 100 different and equally good
\glspl{pdf}. The one used to generate the signal samples (the \emph{nominal}
set) is then obtained by calculating the mean of the 100 error \glspl{pdf} while
the associated intra-\gls{pdf} systematic uncertainty is given by their standard
deviation.

The \gls{pdf} systematic uncertainty is decomposed in:
\begin{itemize}
\item An uncertainty $\Delta \sigma$ on the overall normalization or cross
  section, given by the variation of the total number of signal events.
\item An uncertainty $\Delta A$ on the signal acceptance, which is defined by
  the variation of the ratio of number of signal events determined at the Monte
  Carlo truth level in a particular bin of the signal region divided by the
  total number of signal events.
\end{itemize}
This decomposition is done since the \gls{atlas} standard is to depict the
uncertainty on the overall normalization as an uncertainty on the expected
limits, while the uncertainty on acceptance is to be incorporated in the
uncertainty on the observed limits. \cref{fig:pdf_syst} presents an example of
the results in terms of weighted signal yields for the acceptance as a function
of the \gls{pdf} family and error \gls{pdf} set. It shows the inter- and
intra-\gls{pdf} uncertainties of the three families. The final \gls{pdf}
uncertainty on the number of signal events is the envelope that contains the
error bands of the three families.

  CT10 and MMHT. The $x$-axis represents the different systematic uncertainties
  associated to each \gls{pdf} set.}

\end{figure}

The \gls{pdf} uncertainties affect both the overall \gls{susy} compressed signal
normalization or cross section and the signal acceptance (the probability for a
signal events to have kinematic characteristics that fits the signal region
definition or of a particular bin of the signal region). These uncertainties are
collected in \cref{tab:susy_pdfsysts}. The two main features are that the
systematic uncertainty grows with higher $\met$ bin and with higher squark
masses. The increase of the uncertainty on the cross section with the mass of
the squark is due to the higher momentum fraction of the partons required for
its production. At these energy regimes the \glspl{pdf} are less well known. A
similar behavior is seen for the acceptance at higher $\met$ values which probes
less precisely known regions of the \glspl{pdf}. At low squark masses and in the
low $\met$ bin the systematic uncertainty increases due to low Monte Carlo
statistics.

% variation in the event yield (y-axis) for the three PDF sets, each systematic
% variation of each PDF set is represented by a different position on the the

% \begin{itemize}
% \item An uncertainty $\Delta \sigma$ on the overall normalisation or cross

% uncertainty on the acceptance increases for higher squark masses and at higher
