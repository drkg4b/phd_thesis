The theoretical uncertainties associated to the ADD signal derive from the
uncertainties on the parton distribution function, the renormalization and
factorization scales, the tuning of the parton shower in
Pythia~\cite{PythiaManual} and the initial and final state radiation
modeling. The estimation of the theoretical uncertainties is outlined in the
following sections.
