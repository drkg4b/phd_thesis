The cross section can be separated in a short distance partonic component coming
from the hard scatter process and long distance terms describing the original
hadron~\cite{FactorizationScale}.

The \emph{factorization scale} is the scale that separates the long distance
effects from the short distance ones~\cite{PerturbativeQCDHandbook}. To absorbs
all very-short time physics and ultraviolet divergences renormalization is
applied and the coupling constant becomes dependent on the scale at which it is
computed. The \emph{renormalization scale} is the scale at which the running
coupling constant is evaluated. In \gls{qcd} the choice of renormalization scale
is ambiguous and introduces a non-physical parameter. The uncertainty due to the
choice of these two scales affects the cross section and is derived in
Ref.~\cite{SquarkGluinoTeam} by varying them simultaneously by a factor 2 and
1/2. The uncertainty is found to be 13\% when taking an envelope of the observed
variations. For the monojet analysis this is a conservative approach due to the
higher value of squark masses investigated by the authors of
Ref.~\cite{SquarkGluinoTeam}. This uncertainty is added in quadrature to the
cross section uncertainty on the \glspl{pdf} collected in
\cref{tab:susy_pdfsysts}.
