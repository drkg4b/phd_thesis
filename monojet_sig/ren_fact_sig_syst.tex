The two scales are varied simultaneously by factor 2 and 1/2, in truth-level
\gls{mc} samples. The final uncertainty is the average between the up and down
variations. The scale variation affects mainly the cross sections, which vary
between 23\% and 36\%. The uncertainties are collected in \note{confusing, need
  to get the right table}.
