Systematic uncertainties can originate from the theory, caused for example by
our limited knowledge of the parton distribution function, or from experimental
sources such as the absolute jet energy scale and resolution or production cross
section for various processes determination. The systematic uncertainties are
treated as Gaussian nuisance parameters in the global likelihood fit described
in \cref{sec:glob-simult-likel}.
