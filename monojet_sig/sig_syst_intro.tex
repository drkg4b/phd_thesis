The theoretical uncertainties associated to the \gls{susy} compressed signal
models derive from the uncertainties on the parton distribution function, the
renormalization and factorization scales, the tuning of the parton shower in the
Monte Carlo generator and the initial and final state radiation modeling. The
estimation of the theoretical uncertainties is outlined in the following
sections.
