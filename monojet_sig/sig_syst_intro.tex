The theoretical uncertainties associated to the \gls{susy} compressed signal
models arise from the uncertainties on the parton distribution function, the
renormalization and factorization scales, the tuning of the parton shower in the
Monte Carlo generator and the initial and final state radiation modeling and
uncertainties associated to the parton shower matching. The estimation of the
theoretical uncertainties is presented in the following sections.
