\gls{mb} events are soft ($\pt < 2$~GeV) inelastic interactions which constitute
a significant fraction of the hadron-hadron collisions. Understanding \gls{mb}
processes is therefore important for precision measurements of hard scatter
interactions. Perturbative \gls{qcd} is commonly used to describe parton
interactions when possible and non-perturbative \gls{qcd} for low $\pt$
processes. The free parameters of these models (\emph{tune parameters}) need to
be tuned in the \gls{mc} generators in order to replicate experimental data. The
variation of these parameters may lead to different number of generated events
in the \gls{mc} samples and thus to uncertainty in the acceptance. Following the
\gls{atlas} recommendation given in Ref.~\cite{MCTuningRecommendations2015} five
tune parameters have been varied in order to account for uncertainties from:
\begin{itemize}
\item Underlying event effects.
\item Jet structure effects.
\item Aspects of the \gls{mc} generation that provide extra jet production.
\end{itemize}
The \gls{susy} compressed signal samples are produced with
MADGRAPH~\cite{MADGRAPH}, thus an additional matching scale systematic
uncertainty is considered.% set of systematic uncertainties
% need to be considered. The following uncertainties are considered at the MADGRPH
% level:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Renormalization and factorization scale varied by a factor 0.5 and 2.
% \item Initial state radiation: vary the scale for the $gqq$ and $ggg$ vertices,
% \item Jet matching: vary the qcut for the CKKW matching 0.5, 1, 2
% \end{itemize}
For each squark mass 16 \gls{mc} samples are produced and compared at the truth
level. The resulting envelope of the systematic uncertainties affects the signal
acceptance and are added in quadrature, the results are presented in
\cref{tab:susy_tune}.
