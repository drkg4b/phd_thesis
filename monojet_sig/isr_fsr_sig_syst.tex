Following the ATLAS recommendation given in
Ref.~\cite{MCTuningRecommendations2015} a set of five Monte Carlo generation
tune parameters are varied in order to cover uncertainties from
\begin{itemize}
\item Underlying event effects,
\item Jet structure effects,
\item Aspects of MC generation that provides extra jet production
\end{itemize}
The \gls{susy} compressed signal samples are produced with {\sc madgraph}, thus
an additional set of systematic uncertainties need to be considered. The
following uncertainties are considered at the {\sc madgraph} level:
\begin{itemize}
\item Renormalization and factorization scale varied by a factor 0.5 and 2.
\item Initial state radiation: vary the scale for the $gqq$ and $ggg$ vertices,
\item Jet matching: vary the qcut for the MLM matching 0.5, 1, 2
\end{itemize}
For each squark mass 16 systematic samples are produced and analysed at truth
level. The resulting effect on the acceptance is evaluated in each $\met$ bin
of the signal region and presented in \cref{tab:susy_tune}.

    spectra signal region acceptance as function of the $\met$ bin in the signal
    region, from tune, initial and final state radiation systematic
    uncertainties. The final value is a common envelope valid for all the
    \gls{susy} compressed models.}
