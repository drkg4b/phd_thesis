Experimental systematic uncertainties can be divided in the following broad
categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Jet/$\met$}: This category includes uncertainties on the $\met$
  and jet energy scale and resolution, jet quality, pile--up estimation and
  $\pt$ measurement.
\item \textbf{Leptons}: This category includes uncertainties related to the
  identification, simulation, reconstruction efficiencies and energy and
  momentum resolution of electrons and muons.
\item \textbf{Luminosity}: Is the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity.
\end{itemize}
A $\pm 5\%$ uncertainty is assigned to the \emph{integrated luminosity}. Since
the efficiency plateau of the HLT\_xe70 is reached below 250~GeV $\met$ values,
no uncertainty is assigned to the trigger. Uncertainties in the jet and $\met$
\emph{energy scale} and \emph{resolution} contribute to the total background
with a variation of $\pm 0.5\%$ and $\pm 1.6\%$ in the IM1 and IM7
respectively. The jet quality requirement, pile--up estimation and correction to
the measured $\met$ and jet $\pt$ results in an uncertainty in the estimation of
the total background of $\pm 0.2\%$ in the IM1 and $\pm 0.9 \%$ in the IM7
control region. Lepton \emph{identification} simulation and
\emph{reconstruction efficiency} lead to a $\pm 0.1\%$ uncertainty in the IM1
and IM7 regions while energy and momentum \emph{resolution} results in a $\pm
1.4\%$ variation in the IM1 selection and a $\pm 2.6\%$ uncertainty in the IM7
signal region.
