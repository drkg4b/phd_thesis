Many experimental \gls{susy} searches are not sensitive to models where the mass
difference between some of the supersymmetric particles is too small. The search
carried out using the data collected by the \gls{atlas} detector in 2015 and
presented in this chapter focus on this situation, in particular for squark pair
production, where the neutralinos are only slightly lighter than the squark.
